# Welcome the git tutorial Introduction!
This tutorial aims to teach you how to use `git` in an efficient manner for
your projects.  This guide does not focus on `git` commands,  but rather on
the things you need to do in order to write code in an easy to maintain
fashion.

## Identity
When using `git` for the first time, the first step you need to do is to
identify yourself, so that whoever is interested in the portion of code you
wrote, they can easily reach you for further questions.  In order to identify
yourself, you need to specify your name and email address to the `git` engine.
This is intuitively done using the `git config` command:
```
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR@EMAIL.ADDRESS"
```
Run these commands on your local computer; make sure you use a valid name and
email address!
